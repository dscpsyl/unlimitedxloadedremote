# Unlimited x Loaded Board Remote

Some time ago, I broke my remove on a fall and I needed a replacement. I couldn't find anything online for 3D printed parts so I, with a friend, made my own. 

1. In the `photos` dir, there are photos of my broken remote and what we used to extract rough measurements. 
2. In the `parts` dir, there are the part files for you to use and modify to make them more accurate.
